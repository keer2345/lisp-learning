Common Lisp supports two kinds of variables:
- lexical
- dynamic

I'll start by discussing a few aspects of Lisp's variables that apply to both kinds and then cover the specific characteristics of lexical and dynamic variables. Then I'll discuss Common Lisp's general-purpose assignment operator, **SETF**, which is used to assign new values to variables and just about every other place that can hold a value.

## Variable Basics


Common Lisp is *dynamically typed*--type errors are detected dynamically. 

**LET**
```
(let (variable*)
  body-form*)
```


```lisp
CL-USER> (defun foo(x)
	   (format t "Parameter: ~a~%" x)
	   (let ((x 2))
	     (format t "Outer LET: ~a~%" x)
	     (let ((x 3))
	       (format t "Inner LET: ~a~%" x))
	     (format t "Outer LET again: ~a~%" x))
	   (format t "Parameter again: ~a~%" x))
FOO
CL-USER> (foo 1)
Parameter: 1
Outer LET: 2
Inner LET: 3
Outer LET again: 2
Parameter again: 1
NIL
```

__LET*__
```lisp
CL-USER> (let* ((x 10)
		(y (+ x 10)))
	   (list x y))
(10 20)
CL-USER> (let ((x 10))
	   (let ((y (+ x 10)))
	     (list x y)))
(10 20)
```

## Lexical Variables and Closures

The key thing to understand about closures is that it's the binding, not the value of the variable, that's captured. Thus, a closure can not only access the value of the variables it closes over but can also assign new values that will persist between calls to the closure. For instance, you can capture the closure created by the previous expression in a global variable like this:
```lisp
CL-USER> (defparameter *fn* 
	   (let ((count 0)) 
	     #'(lambda () (setf count (1+ count)))))
*FN*
CL-USER> (funcall *fn*)
1
CL-USER>  (funcall *fn*)
2
CL-USER>  (funcall *fn*)
3
```

Then each time you invoke it, the value of count will increase by one.

A single closure can close over many variable bindings simply by referring to them. Or multiple closures can capture the same binding. For instance, the following expression returns a list of three closures, one that increments the value of the closed over `count` binding, one that decrements it, and one that returns the current value:
```lisp
CL-USER> (let ((count 0))
	   (list
	    #'(lambda () (incf count))
	    #'(lambda () (decf count))
	    #'(lambda () count)))
(#<CLOSURE (LAMBDA ()) {10016EF91B}> #<CLOSURE (LAMBDA ()) {10016EF93B}>
 #<CLOSURE (LAMBDA ()) {10016EF95B}>)
```

## Dynamic, a.k.a. Special, Variables

Common Lisp provides two ways to create global variables: **DEFVAR** and **DEFPARAMETER**. Both forms take a variable name, an initial value, and an optional documentation string. As you've seen in previous chapters, global variables are conventionally named with names that start and end with `*`.
```lisp
CL-USER> (defvar *count* 0
	   "Count of widgets made so far.")
*COUNT*
CL-USER> (defparameter *gap-tolerance* 0.001
	   "Tolerance to be allowed in widget gaps.")
*GAP-TOLERANCE*
```
The difference between the two forms is that **DEFPARAMETER** always assigns the initial value to the named variable while **DEFVAR** does so only if the variable is undefined. 

After defining a variable with **DEFVAR** or **DEFPARAMETER**, you can refer to it from anywhere. For instance, you might define this function to increment the count of widgets made:
```lisp
CL-USER> (defun inscrement-widget-count () (incf *count*))
INSCREMENT-WIDGET-COUNT
CL-USER> (inscrement-widget-count)
1
CL-USER> (inscrement-widget-count)
2
```
```lisp
CL-USER> (defvar *x* 10)
*X*
CL-USER> (defun foo () (format t "X: ~d~%" *x*))
WARNING: redefining COMMON-LISP-USER::FOO in DEFUN
FOO
CL-USER> (foo)
X: 10
NIL
```
The **DEFVAR** creates a global binding for the variable `*x*` with the value 10. The reference to `*x*` in foo will look up the current binding dynamically. If you call foo from the top level, the global binding created by the **DEFVAR** is the only binding available, so it prints 10.

But you can use **LET** to create a new binding that temporarily shadows the global binding, and foo will print a different value.
```lisp
CL-USER> (let ((*x* 20)) (foo))
X: 20
NIL
```
Now call foo again, with no **LET**, and it again sees the global binding.
```lisp
CL-USER> (foo)
X: 10
NIL
```
Now define another function. Note that the middle call to `foo` is wrapped in a **LET** that binds `*x*` to the new value 20. When you run `bar`, you get this result:
```lisp
CL-USER> (defun bar ()
	   (foo)
	   (let ((*x* 20)) (foo))
	   (foo))
BAR
CL-USER> (bar)
X: 10
X: 20
X: 10
NIL
```
As with lexical bindings, assigning a new value affects only the current binding. To see this, you can redefine `foo` to include an assignment to `*x*`.
```lisp
CL-USER> (defun foo ()
	   (format t "Before assignment~18tX: ~d~%" *x*)
	   (setf *x* (1+ *x*))
	   (format t "After assignment~18tX: ~d~%" *x*))
FOO
CL-USER> (foo)
Before assignment X: 10
After assignment  X: 11
NIL
CL-USER> (bar)
Before assignment X: 11
After assignment  X: 12
Before assignment X: 20
After assignment  X: 21
Before assignment X: 12
After assignment  X: 13
NIL
```

## Constants

All constants are global and are defined with **DEFCONSTANT**. The basic form of **DEFCONSTANT** is like **DEFPARAMETER**.
```
(defconstant name initial-value-form [ documentation-string ])
```

Lisp programmers follow a naming convention of using names starting and ending with `+` for constants.


## Assignment

Once you've created a binding, you can do two things with it: get the current value and set it to a new value.
```
(setf place value)
```

## Generalized Assignment

```
Simple variable:    (setf x 10) 
Array:              (setf (aref a 0) 10)
Hash table:         (setf (gethash 'key hash) 10)
Slot named 'field': (setf (field o) 10)
```
