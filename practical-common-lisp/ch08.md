# [8. Macros: Defining Your Own](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/macros-defining-your-own.html)

## The Story of Mac: A Just-So Story

## Macro Expansion Time vs. Runtime
```
(defmacro ww (condition &rest body)
  `(if ,condition (progn ,@body)))

(defun foo (x)
  (ww (> x 10) (print 'big)))
```
The backquote expression will then generate this code:
```
(if (> x 10) (progn (print 'big)))
```
## DEFMACRO
```
(defmacro name (parameter*)
  "Optional documentation string."
  body-form*)
```

The steps to writing a macro are as follows:
1. Write a sample call to the macro and the code it should expand into, or vice versa.
1. Write code that generates the handwritten expansion from the arguments in the sample call.
1. Make sure the macro abstraction doesn't "leak."
