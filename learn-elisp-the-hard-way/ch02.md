# [Lesson 2-1 - First Elisp Programme](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-2-1-first-elisp-programme.rst)
## Let's Get Started
This lesson will show you how to execute your first Elisa programme.

start Emacs
go to the scratch buffer by using the menu Buffers -> `*scratch*`
```lisp
(+ 1 2)
```

Then put the cursor at the **end** of the expression -- `C - j`:
```
3
```

Elisp is a dialect of Lisp - which stands for List Processing. A list is any thing between two brackets `(` and `)`.

```lisp
(+ 1.0e+3 2.0e-2)
```
Now put the cursor at the end of the expression and type `C-x C-e`, in the window nothing will change by the value is now placed in the minibuffer `1000.02`.

```lisp
(+ 1 2)
3
(+ 1.0 2.0)
3.0
(+ 1.0e+3 2.0e-2)
1000.02
```
## What You Have Learnt
You have learnt how to evaluate a basic Elisp expression (or form) in the scratch buffer.
## Extra Activities
Try some expressions that add integers to floats. What is the result?

What happens if you use scientific integers like 1e+10?

Can you add negative numbers?

What do you think the following expressions will return?
```
(- 3 4)
(* 4 5)
(/ 1.0 4.0)
```
Evaluate the following expressions and try and work out why they return what they do?
```
(/ 1 4)
(/ 1 4.)
```

What do you think these symbols represent?

```
#b10101010
#o127
#x12DE
```

(**Tip**: try using them in arithmetic expressions)
What do you think these symbols represent?

```
1.0e+INF
-1.0e+INF
0.0e+NaN or -0.0e+NaN
```
