# [Lesson 2-1 - First Elisp Programme](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-2-1-first-elisp-programme.rst)
## Let's Get Started
This lesson will show you how to execute your first Elisa programme.

start Emacs
go to the scratch buffer by using the menu Buffers -> `*scratch*`
```lisp
(+ 1 2)
```

Then put the cursor at the **end** of the expression -- `C - j`:
```
3
```

Elisp is a dialect of Lisp - which stands for List Processing. A list is any thing between two brackets `(` and `)`.

```lisp
(+ 1.0e+3 2.0e-2)
```
Now put the cursor at the end of the expression and type `C-x C-e`, in the window nothing will change by the value is now placed in the minibuffer `1000.02`.

```lisp
(+ 1 2)
3
(+ 1.0 2.0)
3.0
(+ 1.0e+3 2.0e-2)
1000.02
```
## What You Have Learnt
You have learnt how to evaluate a basic Elisp expression (or form) in the scratch buffer.
## Extra Activities
Try some expressions that add integers to floats. What is the result?

What happens if you use scientific integers like 1e+10?

Can you add negative numbers?

What do you think the following expressions will return?
```
(- 3 4)
(* 4 5)
(/ 1.0 4.0)
```
Evaluate the following expressions and try and work out why they return what they do?
```
(/ 1 4)
(/ 1 4.)
```

What do you think these symbols represent?

```
#b10101010
#o127
#x12DE
```

(**Tip**: try using them in arithmetic expressions)
What do you think these symbols represent?

```
1.0e+INF
-1.0e+INF
0.0e+NaN or -0.0e+NaN
```

# [Lesson 2-2 - Primitive Data Types (1)](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-2-2-primitive-data-types-1.rst)
## Context
This lessons will look at the other sorts of data types in Elisp. There are two different sorts of data types:

- primitive data types
- non-primitive data types

The general set of primitive data types of Elisp are:

- integer
- float
- string
- character
- bool-vector
- symbol
- sequence
- cons
- array
- vector
- char-table
- hash-table
- function
- primitive function (or subr)
- macro
- byte-code
- auto-load

These primitive data types largely correspond to the primitive data types of other Lisps.

In addition Elisp has a number of data types that are peculiar to it, because they pertain to the fact that Elisp is the scripting language of an editor. These data types are:

- buffer
- marker
- window
- frame
- terminal
- window configuration
- frame configuration
- process
- stream
- keymap
- overlay
- font

## What This Lesson Will Cover

This lesson will look at:

- the representation of boolean values
- the integer and float data types which were introduced earlier
- the string data type
- testing for data types
- casting between values

## Booleans
```lisp
(= 1 1)
t
```
```lisp
(= 1 2)
nil
```
```lisp
(if t "it's true" "it's false")
"it's true"
```
```lisp
(if () "it's true" "it's false")
"it's false"
```
```lisp
(if 101 "it's true" "it's false")
"it's true"
```

## String
```lisp
(concat "ab" "cd")
"abcd"
```

```lisp
(concat "a`b" "c\"d")
"a`bc\"d"
```

```lisp
(concat "ab" "cd" "ef" "12" "34" "45")
"abcdef123445"
```

## Predicate Functions - Testing The Types Of Vaules
```lisp
(integerp 11)
t
```
```lisp
(integerp (+ 1 2.0))
nil
```
## Converting Between Data Types

```lisp
(+ 1 2.5)
3.5
```

```lisp
(float 1)
1.0
```

```lisp
(number-to-string 1234)
"1234"
```

```lisp
(string-to-number "1234")
1234
```

# [Lesson 2-3 - Lists (At Last)](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-2-3-lists-at-last.rst)
## Data Lists
```lisp
'(1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
```
```lisp
(quote (1 2 3))
(1 2 3)
```
```lisp
(list 1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
```
```lisp
`(1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
```
## Nested Expressions
```lisp
(+ 1 (* 2 3))
7
```
```lisp
(* 2 3)
6
```
```lisp
(+ 1 6)
7
```

# [Lesson 2-4 - Symbols And Variables](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-2-4-symbols-and-variables.rst)

## Symbols Overview
Symbols can contain different things:

- operators or functions
- data values
- property lists
- the print name of the symbol

## Symbols As Function Names

Symbols can be the name of functions (or operators). We will look into how these are set in a later lesson.

## Symbols As Variables
```lisp
9
9
```

```lisp
fill-column
70
```

You give a symbol a value using the operators `set` and `setq`. **These define global variables**.
```lisp
(set 'do_tell '11)
11

do_tell
11
```
Notice that when the value of `do_tell` was set `do_tell` was quoted viz `'do_tell`. The quoting says to Elisp "don't treat do_tell as a variable is a value to be passed to the operator set". The operator `setq` just absorbs that quote and lets you not quote the first parameter.
```lisp
(setq do_tell '22)
22

(+ do_tell 33)
55
```
There is a variant on `set` and `setq` called `defvar` that defines a variable. It is different from them in that it only applies to uninitialised variables. If a variable is already defined it won't overwrite it.
```lisp
(defvar frame_dell 123)
frame_dell

frame_dell
123

(defvar frame_dell 234)
frame_dell

frame_dell
123
```
## Constant Variables And Keyword Symbols
Some symbols can't be redefined. We have met a couple of them before `nil` and `t`. Dy design all symbols which begin with `:` are also constant values.
## Property Lists

# [Lesson 2-5 - Arrays (And Sequences)](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-2-5-arrays-and-sequences.rst)

## Introduction
We have seen lists in Elisp. Lists are an example of a sequence - a load of things stored in another thing which we can access sequentially.

There is another type of sequence in Elisp - an array. Arrays themselves come in 2 flavours:

- strings
- vectors
- bool-vector
- char-table


The relationship of all these things is shown below:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/raw/master/images/elisp-sequences.png">
</div>

This lesson will look at:

- strings
- vectors

## Why Arrays And Not Lists?
The difference between arrays and lists is that arrays have fixed lengths and lists have variable length. This gives them different performance characteristics - array elements are accessible in constant time, whereas the access time for lists is proportional to their length.

## Difference Between Strings And Vectors

In Elisp a string is simply an array whose elements consists of the integers which represent unicode points. A vector is a general array whose elements are any valid Elisp term.

## Why Only 1D Arrays?
Arrays are 1 dimensional only. Given that the elements of a vector can consist of other valid Elisp symbol, multi-dimensional arrays can be implemented as vectors of vectors.

A array is delimited by square brackets (`[` and `]`). You can create them inline:
```lisp
[1 2 3]
```


You can create vectors using the `vector` operator:
```lisp
(vector 1 2 3)
[1 2 3]
```

The operator `string` does the same for strings. To create a string you need array elements that are the integers which represent characters - a full set of unicode values is supported.
```lisp
(string 97 98 99)
"abc"
```
