# [Lesson 3-1 - Writing Functions](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-3-1-writing-functions.rst)

## Script Mode Elisp
```
emacs --no-site-file --script first_programme.el
```
- The option `--no-site-file` means that emacs doesn't load any Elisp from the site libraries.
- By default the `--script` option also includes option `--no-init-file`. Normally emacs starts and executes a init file. In Ubuntu this file is `.emacs` in the users home directory.

`message.el`:
```lisp
(message "Bonjour Tout Le Monde")
```
Run:
```
emacs --no-site-file --script message.el
```

The output should be:
```
Bonjour Tout Le Monde
```
## Defining A Simple Function
`message2.el`:
```lisp
(defun bonjour () (message "Bonjour Tout Le Monde"))
(bonjour)
```

```
> emacs --no-site-file --script message2.el
Bonjour Tout Le Monde
```

## Defining A More Complex Function
`message3.el`:
```lisp
(defun tough_maths (i j k)
  "jeepers maths is tough!"
  (message (number-to-string (+ i j k))))
(tough_maths 3 4 5)
```
```
> emacs --no-site-file --script message3.el
12
```
## Functions With Variable Numbers Of Arguments
`message4.el`:
```lisp
(defun variable_arity (a &optional b &rest c)
   "This is a function which has variable arity"
   (message (concat "variable a is " a))
   (message (concat "variable b is " b))
   (if c (message "c is not an empty list") (message "c is an empty list")))
(message "run the fn with 1 variable")
(variable_arity "eh")
(message "run the fn with 2 variables")
(variable_arity "eh" "bee")
(message "run the fn with 3 variables")
(variable_arity "eh" "bee" "see")
(message "run the fn with 4 variables")
(variable_arity "eh" "bee" "see" "dee")
(message "run the fn with 5 variables")
(variable_arity "eh" "bee" "see" "dee" "eee")
```
The result is:
```
run the fn with 1 variable
variable a is eh
variable b is
c is an empty list
run the fn with 2 variables
variable a is eh
variable b is bee
c is an empty list
run the fn with 3 variables
variable a is eh
variable b is bee
c is not an empty list
run the fn with 4 variables
variable a is eh
variable b is bee
c is not an empty list
run the fn with 5 variables
variable a is eh
variable b is bee
c is not an empty list
```

# [Lesson 3-2 - More Functions](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-3-2-more-functions.rst)
## Introduction
The functions we built in the previous lesson were a bit useless. This lesson will look at some more sophisticated functions:

- ones which can use local variables
- recursive functions

## Functions With Local Variables
```lisp
(let ((first "hey")
      (second "ho"))
  (message first)
  (message second))
```
When we try and run this we get an error message printed out:
```
hey
ho
```



```lisp
(defun myfun (a b c d)
    "This is a nonce function designed to show how to use local variables safely"
    (let ((e (+ a b))
        (f (* c d)))
        (- e f)))
(message (number-to-string (myfun 7 5 3 1)))
```
The result should be:
```
9
```

## Recursive Functions
`message5.el`:
```lisp
(defun print_int (n)
  "This function prints a list of integers in reverse order"
  (message (number-to-string n))
  (if (= n 0) (message "That's all folks!") (print_int(- n 1))))

(print_int 5)
```
```
5
4
3
2
1
0
That's all folks!
```
