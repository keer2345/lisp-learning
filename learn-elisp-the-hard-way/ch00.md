# [Learning Elisp](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/learning-elisp.rst)

## Who This Book Is For
This book is for people who can already programme, but who are not familiar with functional programming. It is suitable for most programmers with experience in popular programming languages like Ruby, Java, Python, Perl, C, C++ and so on.

It assumes that the reader can get a clean install of Ubuntu GNU/Linux up and running.

## How This Book Teaches Elisp
This book teaches Elisp through the medium of Emacs. Emacs has a scratch window in which arbitrary Elisp expressions can be evaluated. Initial lessons will use the scratch window. Later lessons will move on to creating external lisp files and loading them into Emacs to use them.

# [Why Did I Write This Book?](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/why-did-I-write-this-book.rst)
## Why Elisp?
Emacs is the most prominent piece of software in the *apostolic* tradition. You are supposed to learn it by being instructed by someone who learnt it by being instructed by someone recursively all the way back to the original authors in a continuous apostolic succession.

I would fain be the John Knox, the Calvin, the Luther, and hell mend them.

By writing this book I hope to be able to write Elisp to configure and extend Emacs in my working environment.

## Why Choose This Format?
The other appealing part of this format is that it isn't a reference book. To make clear just how unsuited I am to write a reference book about Lisp, let me enumerate ATTIDNK (All The Things I Do Not Know):
- the difference between Emacs and XEmacs
- the difference between Elisp and Lisp
- how Common Lisp is related to Clojure or any other Lisp
- how Lisp does package management
- pretty much everything else I would need to know to write a reference book

## On Learning Functional Programming
If you just want to learn a **functional programming language** you really should learn *Erlang* and I recommend [Joe's book](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Erlang-Software-Concurrent-World/dp/193435600X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1290296292&sr=1-2) or [Franceso and Simon's one](http://www.amazon.com/ERLANG-Programming-Francesco-Cesarini/dp/0596518188/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1290296292&sr=1-1).

# [Who Is This Book For?](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/who-is-this-book-for.rst)
## Target Audience
The target audience for this book is people with some experience of programming in a non-functional programming language:

- procedural languages like Fortran, Algol, C etc, etc
- object orientated languages like C++, Java, Ruby etc, etc
- scripting languages like PHP, Python, Perl etc, etc

If you have already mastered a 'conventional' Functional Programming language this book might not be for you - there are good books about learning a variety of Lisps out there. Functional Programming languages include:

- Lisp and it dialects like Scheme, Clojure, Common Lisp (CL) etc, etc
- Erlang
- Haskell


## How Much Experience Is Needed?
If you can write a small programme to do something in a non-functional programming language from scratch then you should be experienced enough.

# [What This Book Will Cover?](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/what-will-this-book-cover.rst)
## What's In
This book will cover enough Elisp to enable you to:

- understand .emacs files
- write your own functions to put in .emacs files
- create your own Emacs menu's
- write functions that execute on events like opening and closing a file
- attach functions to key strokes to enable you to customise the behaviour of your Emacs

## What's Not In
This book will not teach you enough Lisp to be an proper Lisp developer.

# [References](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/references.rst)
The GNU organisation has published a book on programming in Elisp. It is entitled [An Introduction To Programming In Elisp](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/).

There is also a reference manual - the [GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/elisp/index.html#Top).

There is also a commercially published book [Writing GNU Emacs Extensions](http://astore.amazon.com/hypernumbersc-20/detail/1565922611).

Where appropriate this book will refer you to these works for further reading.
