# [Lesson 5-1 - Elisp In Files](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-5-1-elisp-in-files.rst)
## Introduction
```
mkdir -p .emacs.d/omars-dir
touch .emacs.d/omars-dir/myomar.el
```
`myomar.el`:
```lisp
(defun omar-hip ()
    (interactive)
    (message "hip, hop, don't stop"))
(defun omar-hotel ()
    (interactive)
    (message "hotel, motel, holiday inn"))
```

In order to make this available to us we need to add the path to `load-path`. This is done in our `.emacs.d/init.el` file:
```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/omars-dir")
```
## Using Our File
To get this to autoload we add the following line to our `.emacs.d/init.el` file after the line where we have added `~/.emacs.d/omars-dir/` to the `load-path`:
```lisp
(require 'myomar)
```

and we add this line at the top of `myomar.el`:
```lisp
(provide 'myomar)
```
## Our Execution Model
This is the execution model we will use from now on:

- create a custom file or files in a standard directory
- edit `.emacs.d/init.el` to run an initialisation function

The initialisation function will do a number of things:

- set up the global environment
- change menus, tool-bars and key bindings
- load the code that is needed

# [Lesson 5-2 - Working With Buffers (1)](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-5-2-working-with-buffers-1.rst)
## Introduction
We need to learn how to programme Elisp a bit better, and the best way to do that is to write some programmes that add functionality to Emacs itself.

In this lesson we are going to:

- add a menu to Emacs
- call functions from that menu which operate on the current buffer

To do that we will create a file of Elisp which will:

- define some functions
- add an Emacs menu bound to those functions

We will then edit the `.emacs.d/init.el` file to load our Elisp file at start up.

## Preparing Our Elisp File
Create a new file called `omarmenu.el` in the directory `~/.emacs.d/omars-dir/` and type the following code in:

```lisp
(defun omar-count ()
  (interactive)
  (message "When we have finished this will count the number of words in the current buffer"))

(defvar menu-bar-omar-menu (make-sparse-keymap "Omar"))

(define-key-after global-map [menu-bar omar]
  (cons "Omar's Menu" (make-sparse-keymap "Omar")))

(define-key global-map [menu-bar omar omar-count]
  '(menu-item "Count" omar-count
             :help "Will eventually count words in the current buffer!"))

(global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'omar-count)

(provide 'omarmenu)
```

Then open your `.emacs.d/init.el` file in your home directory add the following lines - You might want to delete everything that is in it first:
```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/omars-dir")
(require 'omarmenu)
```
## Examining Our Function
We are going to use a lot of Emacs functions to write our function omar-count so we need to learn how to look up their documentation.

Let's start by examining our own function. We will use the built-in Emacs function describe-function. It can be called in the usual way:

- `M - x` describe-function
- then enter omar-count into the modeline.

You should see something like this:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/raw/master/images/emacs-using-describe-function.png">
</div>

Let's add a proper function definition for our function. Edit omarmenu.el:
```lisp
(defun omar-count ()
    (interactive)
    "This function counts the number of words in the current buffer"
    (message "When we have finished this will count the number of words in the current buffer"))
```

To see this help string in action you will need to either select the menu item Emacs-Lisp -> Evaluate Buffer or close and re-open emacs before typing `M - x` describe-function

## Implementing The Function

Now that we have the function wired in, lets make it do what it says on the tin. Edit the function to look like this:
```lisp
(defun omar-count ()
  "this is a omar-count document"
  (interactive)
  (let ((count 0))
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (< (point) (point-max))
           (forward-word 1)
           (setq count (1+ count)))
    (message "Buffer has %d words." count)))
```


```lisp
(defun omar-count ()
  "this is a omar-count document"
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
      (let ((count 0))
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (while (< (point) (point-max))
               (forward-word 1)
               (setq count (1+ count)))
        (message "Buffer has %d words." count))))
```

# [Lesson 5-3 - Scope Of Variables (set, setq, let, let* etc)](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-5-3-scope-of-variables-set-setq-let-etc.rst)
## Introduction
ELisp has 4 different types of scope:

- global scope
- local scope
- buffer-local scope
- terminal-local scope

## Global Scope
## Buffer-Local Variables
