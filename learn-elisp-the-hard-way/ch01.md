The work on learning Elisp will take place within an X-Windows enabled version of Emacs as shown below.

# [Lesson 1-1 - Using Emacs](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-1-1-using-emacs.rst)
## Learning Emacs
This book is not designed to teach you how to use Emacs. It will teach you enough Emacs to complete the work in this book, but not more.

If you want to learn to use Emacs then you should consider buying a book - I recommend [Learning Gnu Emacs](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781565921528).

## Emacs Components
The version of Emacs we are using has 5 components on it:

- a menubar
- a toolbar
- a window area (it is possible to have multiple window views)
- a mode line
- a minibuffer
