# [Lesson 4-1 - Writing Elisp In Emacs](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-4-1-writing-elisp-in-emacs.rst)
## Introduction
Emacs switches into a special mode for a particular programming language by looking at the extension on the filename - the extension for Elisp is `.el`. If you create a file called *something.el* and open it with Emacs you will see that the editor has changed itself.

</div>

The modeline now contains the expression (Emacs-Lisp) which indicates that it is in the `Emacs Lisp Major Mode`. The menu bar now has an `Emacs-Lisp` menu.

If you execute expressions now, the operator `message` will now output to the minibuffer at the bottom of Emacs.

One of the most important features in the debugger - which is triggered when you instrument a function for debugging using the menu command *Instrument Functions for Debugger*.

Load an Elisp file, and execute it under the debugger. The diagram below shows it working. You can step through the code line-by-line. The debugger shows the values of the last expression executed in the minibuffer at the bottom. In the picture the last expression executed is `a` (as shown by the debugger cursor which is placed after it) - its current value (`7`) is shown in the minibuffer.

# [Lesson 4-2 - Adding Custom Functions To Emacs](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-4-2-adding-custom-functions-to-emacs.rst)
## A Simple Custom Function
`~/.emacs.d/init.el`:
```lisp
(defun doodlebug ()
 "Nonce function"
 (interactive)
 (message "Howdie-doodie fella"))
```

Open your Emacs, Typing `A -x` switches the focus in Emacs to the minibuffer - if you then type in a function name it will be executed. then run `doodlebug`. You should then see the output in the minibuffer:
```
Howdie-doodie fella
```
Look carefully at the function definition. The third parameter of the list is the expression (interactive) - this is necessary if we are to invoke the function from either a key-binding or the minibuffer.

## A Custom Function With User Input
Let's edit the function to take some parameters:

You can't reload the `.emacs.d/init.el` file, but you can manually re-evaluated by using the command Emacs-Lisp -> Evaluate Buffer in the .emacs buffer.
```lisp
(defun doodlebug (a b c)
  "Nonce function"
  (interactive "sAdjective: \nsNoun: \nsExclamation: \n")
  (message "Its a %s thing, this %s, so it is, %s" a b c))
```
```
Adjective:
Noun:
Exclamation:
```

As you type in a string at each prompt (ending with [*Return*]) each of the strings wll be bound to the variables `a`, `b` and `c` in turn.


You can read the full list of [Interactive Codes](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/elisp/html_node/Interactive-Codes.html#Interactive-Codes) in the reference manual.

## Binding The Custom Function To A Key Sequence
To bind the custom function to a key sequence add the following line to the `.emacs.d/init.el` file.
```
(global-set-key [f5] 'doodlebug)
```
# [Lesson 4-3 - Emacs Menus](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-4-3-emacs-menus.rst#lesson-4-3---emacs-menus)
## Introduction
This section will look at creating a new menu in Emacs and binding a custom function to it. Before doing that we need to create a couple of functions in our `.emacs.d/init.el` file to bind to the menu.
## The Basics Of Menus
```lisp
(defun omar-hip ()
  "a nonce menu function"
  (interactive)
  (message "hip, hop, don't stop"))

(defun omar-hotel ()
 "another nonce menu function"
 (interactive)
 (message "hotel, motel, holiday inn"))
```
## The Basics Of Menus
```lisp
(define-key global-map [menu-bar omar]
  (cons "Omar's Menu" (make-sparse-keymap "Omar")))
```
You will see that this has created a new top-level menu at the left of the menu bar. It consists of the words *Omar's Menu*. There are no items below it.

Lets look at that expression - it is defining a new key in the `global-map`. The global map is a data structure which holds details of all key inputs:
- menu items
- toolbar items
- key shortcuts
- etc, etc

You can look at the value of the global keymap by evaluating the expression `(current-global-map)` in the `*scratch*` buffer.

The next parameter is the array `[menu-bar omar]` which tells the global keymap that this new key is under the menu. The final item is a parameter list - in this cause just jusing a normal string as the key. The function `make-sparse-keymap` creates an empty keymap - we will fill this keymap with the menu items later.

You should be quite confused by the terminology now. We are creating menus and all the functions refer to keys. Emacs has a mechanism for handling keyboard events. All the other user input mechanisms (mouse events, menus, toolbar buttons, etc, etc) are all extensions of key-handling mechanisms. Hence the fact that all these things are configured by key related functions.

The menu we have just created is in the wrong place really. The standard Emacs menus are:

- File
- Edit
- Options
- Buffers
- Tools

We can make our menu do that by changing the definition from `define-key` to `define-key-after`.
```lisp
(define-key-after global-map [menu-bar omar]
  (cons "Omar's Menu" (make-sparse-keymap "Omar")))
(define-key global-map [menu-bar omar omar-hip]
  '(menu-item "Hip" omar-hip
             :help "Hip, yeah!"))
(define-key global-map [menu-bar omar separator-replace-tags]
  '(menu-item "--"))
(define-key global-map [menu-bar omar omar-hotel]
  '(menu-item "Hotel" omar-hotel
             :help "Hotel, yeah!"))
```
## Adding New Items To An Existing Menu
```lisp
(defvar menu-bar-omar-menu (make-sparse-keymap "Omar's Menu"))
(define-key menu-bar-omar-menu [omar-hip]
  '(menu-item "Hip" omar-hip
             :help "Hip, yeah!"))
(define-key menu-bar-omar-menu [separator-omar-1]
  '(menu-item "--"))
(define-key menu-bar-omar-menu [omar-hotel]
  '(menu-item "Hotel" omar-hotel
             :help "Hotel, yeah!"))
(define-key menu-bar-edit-menu [omar]
       (list 'menu-item "Omar Menu" menu-bar-omar-menu))
```
# [Lesson 4-4 - Adding Buttons To The Tool-bar](https://github.com/hypernumbers/learn_elisp_the_hard_way/blob/master/contents/lesson-4-4-adding-buttons-to-the-toolbar.rst)
## The Basics Of The Toolbar
```lisp
(define-key global-map [tool-bar omar-button]
'(menu-item "Hotel" omar-hotel
   :help "OMG Omar!"
   :image (image :type xpm :file "omar.xpm")))
```
